# Contributing to Capro

Pull Requests are welcome!

- If you want to work on a completely new feature please make an issue beforehand to discuss if it fits the projects scope.
- Use `php-cs-fixer` to follow the coding standard. This can be called automatically in modern editors on file save.
- Call `vendor\bin\phpstan` to check for errors.
- Make sure it works with all supported PHP versions (see "Requirements" in the README, or composer.json).
- When you test the code you should run "php capro <command>" to make sure you are running the correct script.

If you have any questions or notes about contributing, please ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/xy2z/capro/discussions)
